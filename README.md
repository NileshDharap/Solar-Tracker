# Solar-Tracker
This is a 8051 based small project to track the direction of light. Using LDR we get appropiate voltage which is converted into digital form by ADC0808. This digital voltage (Intensity) will be shown on LCD in percentage and  accordingly the motor will be moved on which the solar panel is to be placed.
